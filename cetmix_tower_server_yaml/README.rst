Use Cases / Context
===================

Being an Odoo module Cetmix Tower benefits from Odoo flexibility and
extendability. However default Odoo data import/export format using
``csv`` and ``xlsx`` is not very convenient for Cetmix Tower entities
such as commands and flight plans. There are more suitable formats for
such data such as ``YAML``. 

Configuration
=============

No configuration is required.

Usage
=====

To export data into YAML format:

-  Open the record you would like to export
-  Copy  YAML code from the text field located under the "YAML" tab in
   the form view

To import data from YAML:

-  Open the record you would like to import
-  Insert YAML code from in the text field located under the "YAML" tab
   in the form view
