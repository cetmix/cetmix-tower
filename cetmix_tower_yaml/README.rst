Use Cases / Context
===================

Being an Odoo module Cetmix Tower benefits from Odoo flexibility and
extendability. However default Odoo data import/export format using
``csv`` and ``xlsx`` is not very convenient for Cetmix Tower entities
such as commands and flight plans. There are more suitable formats for
such data such as ``YAML``. 

Configuration
=============

No configuration is required.

Usage
=====

Data Export/Import
------------------

To export data into YAML format:

-  Open the record you would like to export
-  Copy YAML code from the text field located under the "YAML" tab in
   the form view. Activate "Explode" switch if you want to export data
   in `exploded mode <#exploded-mode>`__

To import data from YAML:

-  Open the record you would like to import
-  Insert YAML code from in the text field located under the "YAML" tab
   in the form view.

Data Export/Import Modes
------------------------

Data stored in related fields such as One2many, Many2one and Many2many
can be handled using two different modes.

Reference mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode related record is represented with its reference:

.. code:: yaml

   file_template_id: my_custom_template

In case related record cannot be resolved using provided reference while
importing data from YAML, ``Null`` value will be assigned instead.

Exploded mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode related record is represented as a child YAML structure:

.. code:: yaml

   file_template_id:
     cetmix_tower_model: file_template
     cetmix_tower_yaml_version: 1
     code: false
     file_name: much_logs.txt
     file_type: text
     keep_when_deleted: false
     name: Very my custom
     note: Hey!
     reference: my_custom_template
     server_dir: /var/log/my/files
     source: server

This mode allows to export/import child records together with the parent
one. In case any of the child fields are modified in YAML related record
in Odoo will be modified using those values. In case related record
cannot be resolved using child reference while importing data from YAML,
new child record will be created in Odoo using YAML values.
