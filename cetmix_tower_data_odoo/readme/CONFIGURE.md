You need to have an instance with enough resources to run Odoo with ssh access to it.

To install Odoo on your instance:

Create a server and configure connection:

    Go to "Cetmix Tower -> Servers -> Servers" and create a new server.
    Put in login credentials on the "General Settings" tab.
    Set variables and secrets.

    Run these flight plans:

    - Init Tower
    - Init Postgres
    - Init Odoo 1

    Go to "Files -> Files" and create files from templates.

    - Init Odoo 2
